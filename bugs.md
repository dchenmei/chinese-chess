# Current Issues
(feel free to add more)

## Critical

1. Difficult Clicking

The current select mechanism is sometimes inaccurate. A good idea would be to reconsider the calculation methods to give a more satisfying click.

## Somewhat Important

1. Error Handling

Currently, the errors are ignored. If user makes an invalid move, it is ignored. A better alternative
would be to have pop ups and warnings.

2. Fuzzy Lines

If you look closely at the box where the king and advisors are, the diagonal lines are not
precise.

3. Other small code maintenance improvements under "TODOs" in files

## Ideas

1. Creating a backend engine for the game, allows for expansion into move analysis

for instance, Chess and Go has many popular engines that allow the game to be ported to different
graphics implementations and allows for move by move calculations.
